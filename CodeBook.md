Activity     The activity performed by each subject while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
             List of activities performed:
             WALKING
             WALKING_UP
             WALKING_DOWN
             SITTING
             STANDING
             LAYING

SubjectID    An identifier of the subject who carried out the activity.Its range is from 1 to 30.
             Subject IDs: 1-30  

Features     The features obtained from the 3-axial raw signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope. The time domain and frequency domain signals are denoted by the prefixes 't' and 'f' 
             respectively.'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. 

	         List of features:
             tBodyAcc-XYZ
	         tGravityAcc-XYZ
	         tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	         tBodyGyro-XYZ
	         tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	         tBodyAccMag
	         tGravityAccMag
	         tBodyAccJerkMag
	         tBodyGyroMag
	         tBodyGyroJerkMag
	         fBodyAcc-XYZ
	         fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	         fBodyGyro-XYZ
	         fBodyAccMag
	         fBodyAccJerkMag
	         fBodyGyroMag
	         fBodyGyroJerkMag


Measurements  The average of the mean and standard deviation (std) of each of the features mentioned above. These measurements were calculated for each activity and each subject (30 volunteers x 6 
              activities each = 180 observations per column).The measurements have been recorded in columns 3-66 in the tidy data file.
